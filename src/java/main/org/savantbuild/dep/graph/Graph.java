/**
 * This interface defines the generic graph data structure.
 * <p/>
 * <h3>Graphs</h3>
 * <p/>
 * Graphs are simple structures that model nodes with any number of connections between nodes. The connections are
 * bi-directional and are called Links. A two node graph with a link between the nodes looks like this:
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 * node1 <---> node2
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * The important point about Graphs is that implementations don't need to enforce a top level node that controls the
 * entire structure like trees do. Instead, implementations can choose to have the graph store all of the nodes and the
 * connections between them allowing for direct access to any node. These implementations should define how the direct
 * access is managed and whether or not duplicate nodes can be stored.
 * <p/>
 * <h3>Generics</h3>
 * <p/>
 * There are two generics for a Graph. The first variable T is the content of the nodes themselves. Each node can stored
 * a single value. The second generic is the value that can be associated with the Link between nodes. This is carried
 * throughout the entire graph structure making it very strongly typed.
